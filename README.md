# BiliBili_DownloadFileProcessor
A naive app to process download files from BiliBili app and turns it to available mp4 or mp3 automatically.

This project uses [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to process media files, and [nlohmann/json] to parse JSON files.
So it should follow  GPL-3.0 License and MIT License respectively.
